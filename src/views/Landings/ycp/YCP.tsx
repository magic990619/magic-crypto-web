          The YAM Bug/Hack Protection Protocol (name/logo/token TBD), is a protocol designed to let those with confidence in the security of a protocol earn yield and those concerned about a bug or a hack to gain access to upside exposure in such an event. If such an event were to occur, a claim would be submitted and the arbiter would rule on its validity, paying out the entire protection pool to those with active coverage.
