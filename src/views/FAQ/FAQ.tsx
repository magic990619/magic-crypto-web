              <span>YAM is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a rebasing mechanism to raise funds for a treasury managed by the community. The community can then use those funds via YAM governance to build out the protocol.</span>

            >
              <span>YAM is the governance token for the YAM protocol. Using token voting, YAM holders have direct influence over the YAM treasury and direction of the protocol. Governance discussions take place on the <ExternalLink href="https://forum.yam.finance/">Yam Governance Forum.</ExternalLink></span>

              question="What is rebasing?"
              slug="rebase"
            >
              <span>Rebasing is a mechanism generally used to promote price stability by increasing the supply when the price is above the target price and decrease supply when price is below the target. YAM is currently pegged to 1 USDC, and uses the YAM/ETH  and ETH/USDC Sushiswap pools to generate a two-hop TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracle to determine the necessary change in supply.</span>
              <span>If YAM price is above 1.05 USDC, YAM supply increases. This is known as a positive rebase.</span>
              <span>If YAM price is below 0.95 USDC, YAM supply decreases. This is known as a negative rebase.</span>
              <span>If YAM price is between 0.95 and 1.05 USDC, YAM does not rebase.</span>
              <span>Every YAM holder gets the same increase or decrease in supply every rebase. However, this increase or decrease is offset by the subsequent increase or decrease in price.</span>

            <Question
              active={activeSlug === "rebase-math"}
              question="What is the math behind each rebase?"
              slug="rebase-math"
            >
              <span>YAM does not try to target $1 all at once, instead attempting to do it over 10 rebase periods.</span>
              <span>To calculate change in supply we need to determine how far from the peg the current price is. This formula is:</span>
              <code>
                Deviation from peg = (Current Price - Target Price) / Target Price
                <br />
                Rebase Amount = Current Supply * (Deviation From Peg/10)
                <br />
                New Supply = Current supply + Rebase Amount
              </code>

            <Question
              active={activeSlug === "rebase-supply"}
              question="Does this mean I gain or lose money every rebase?"
              slug="rebase-supply"
            >
              <span>No. The Uniswap liquidity pools are in sync with every rebase. This means that if supply is increased by 20% in a rebase, price will drop 20% to offset it. </span>
              <span>Imagine the following scenario. YAM is at $2 and you hold 100 YAM. This means your YAM holdings are $200. A rebase comes and it's a positive 20% rebase. You now have 120 YAM but the price will go $1.67, so your YAM holdings are still worth $200!</span>

              question="How does YAM have a treasury?"
              slug="treasury"
            >
              <span>In the Yam protocol, when a positive rebase occurs, 10% of the YAM rebase amount is minted and sold for ETH via the YAM/ETH Sushiswap pool. The ETH is subsequently deposited to the governance-controlled treasury.</span>

              question="Can LPs participate in governance?"
              slug="govlp"
            >
              <span>Only LPs that are staked in the Incentivizer contract can participate in governance. Voting power is determined by distributing the voting power of YAM held in the YAM/ETH Sushiswap pool, but distributed to only YAM Incentivizer stakers. This was done to mitigate flashloan threats in voting, so the Incentivizer contract keeps a record of the necessary values at needed block heights to facilitate those mitigations.</span>

              slug="scaling-factor"
            >
              <span>Because YAM supply is constantly changing due to rebases, itâ€™s hard to keep up with the ever changing supply amount. Yam.finance provides a scaling factor that you can use which allows you to go from initial Yam v3 supply amount to todayâ€™s supply amount.</span>

              <span>yUSD is an interest earning stablecoin generated from <ExternalLink href="https://yearn.finance/vaults">yearn.finance vaults</ExternalLink>. Users are able to deposit yCRV (generated <ExternalLink href="https://www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit">here</ExternalLink>) into the vaults which then yield interest on the deposit over time.</span>
